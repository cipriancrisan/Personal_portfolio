      <p>
        As a junior full-stack web developer with a background in mechanical engineering, I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact in the world. Being a sport and  a nature enthusiast, the human-nature relationship represents the starting point of my every project. Through innovative solutions, my goal is to contribute meaningfully to society and make a positive impact on people's life around me.

      <p>
        In October 2022 I took the leap and embarked on the Le Wagon’s Bootcamp adventure. For 6 intense months, while having a full time job, I spent my evenings and weekends studying, using all my human resources and balancing everything in my life to reach my goal of becoming a full-stack web developer. And I did it, what a thrill this is.
        During this amazing boot camp, I acquired new foundational skills like: Ruby, Ruby On Rails, MVC, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Heroku, GitHub, how to create a project from scratch, how to lead a web development project and many more.
        A big thank you to my Le Wagon community, to all the teachers that were there to support us on every step, and to all my classmates that made this journey an unforgettable one.
        Kudos to my coding mates Stephan Knorn, Lorenzo Bertolino and Fahad Jibran, with whom I worked together to bring to life a wonderful project idea which is AllShare.
